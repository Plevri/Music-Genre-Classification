# Music-Genre-Classification
Data science project that classifies music based on variables in the music's recording.

# 🎵 Music Genre Prediction with PCA & Logistic Regression

This project explores exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification modeling to predict movie genres based on numerical features. It was completed as part of the 365 Data Science certification program to deepen my understanding of core data science techniques.

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Strengthen practical knowledge of Python-based data science workflows
- Apply dimensionality reduction and classification techniques
- Visualize relationships and improve interpretability of high-dimensional data

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **EDA**: Summary statistics, correlation matrix, heatmaps
- **Feature Engineering**: Standardization, eigenvalue analysis
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression for genre classification
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Cleaned and explored the dataset using EDA
2. Visualized feature relationships with correlation matrix and heatmap
3. Standardized variables for PCA and regression
4. Analyzed eigenvalues to select principal components
5. Built a logistic regression model to predict movie genres
6. Evaluated model performance and visualized predictions

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with PCA and logistic regression
- Improved understanding of feature selection and model interpretability
- Reinforced skills in data visualization and preprocessing
